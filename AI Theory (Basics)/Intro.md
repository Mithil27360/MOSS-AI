# Get Started with Artificial Intelligence

## Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

- Explain fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence.
- Identify the challenges that make defining artificial intelligence difficult.
- Describe the types of tasks artificial intelligence can perform.

## Time to Get Fluent in AI
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a dream of many storytellers and sci-fi fans for years. Researchers and computer scientists have turned that dream into reality — we’re already well into the Age of AI.

AI is now a part of our work, school, and personal lives. To have meaningful conversations about AI, we need a shared vocabulary and a solid foundation of core concepts. This guide explores current capabilities and uses of AI.

## The Difficulty of Defining AI
Science fiction often portrays AI as dangerous or world-conquering, distorting public perception. In reality, AI reflects the diversity of intelligence found in humans and animals — from tool-using crows to maze-solving slime molds.

Human intelligence itself has varied forms — mathematical, emotional, creative, and more. Similarly, AI systems are specialized. Each excels in specific types of tasks rather than general intelligence.

## Main Types of AI Capabilities
There is no single AI that can do everything (general AI). Instead, we use specialized AI systems grouped into categories.

### Language Processing
Language processing is a major AI skill, known as Natural Language Processing (NLP). Systems like ChatGPT interpret and act on human language, performing tasks such as:

- Translating documents
- Summarizing text
- Generating code, images, or reports

NLP helps businesses replace chatbots with dynamic AI agents, create sales materials, and optimize productivity.

### Numeric Predictions
AI models excel at prediction, assisting with tasks like:

- Weather forecasting
- Demand prediction
- Medical risk assessment
- Financial projections

These systems use data to output probabilities or numeric values — for instance, the likelihood of an event (0–1) or expected sales figures.

### Classifications
AI classification systems categorize data, helping in decisions such as:

- Detecting phishing emails
- Diagnosing diseases
- Flagging fraudulent transactions
- Identifying toxic comments

Although each classifier specializes in one domain, they often perform equal to or better than humans in repetitive, data-intensive scenarios.

### Robotic Navigation
AI-driven robots and autonomous systems navigate physical and digital environments. Applications include:

- Self-driving vehicles
- Supply chain optimization
- Industrial automation
- Search-and-rescue robotics

From robotic vacuum cleaners avoiding stairs to rescue bots navigating rubble, AIs increasingly adapt to dynamic real-world contexts.

## AI Models and Neural Networks
AI models are advanced algorithms that learn from data to make predictions and decisions. Neural networks, composed of connected nodes and layers, power these models by simulating the structure of the human brain.

Neural networks identify complex patterns between input and output, forming the backbone of intelligent systems across text, vision, and robotics.

## In Summary
Artificial intelligence enables computers to perform tasks traditionally requiring human reasoning, intuition, and inference. From natural language to predictive analytics, AI now underpins solutions across education, business, and industry.
