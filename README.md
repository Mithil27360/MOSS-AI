## Roadmap :

𝟭. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗕𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗰𝘀 (𝟭-𝟮 𝗪𝗲𝗲𝗸𝘀)
→ Pick Python (you’ll use it for everything).
→ Focus on: Loops, functions, object-oriented programming.
→ Tools: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code.
Resource: Google’s Python Class → https://lnkd.in/d9yFJYXP

𝟮. 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀 𝗙𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 (𝟮-𝟯 𝗪𝗲𝗲𝗸𝘀)
→ Topics: Linear Algebra (vectors, matrices), Calculus (derivatives), Probability.
→ Tools: NumPy for practice.
Resource: Mathematics for Machine Learning → mml-book.github.io

𝟯. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀 & 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀 (𝟮-𝟯 𝗪𝗲𝗲𝗸𝘀)
→ Key Skills: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, correlation.
→ Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Resource: Kaggle’s Pandas Course → kaggle.com/learn/pandas

𝟰. 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 (𝟭-𝟮 𝗪𝗲𝗲𝗸𝘀)
→ Learn how to handle missing data, outliers, and feature scaling.
→ Tools: Pandas, Scikit-learn.
Resource: Hands-On Machine Learning by Aurelien Geron → https://lnkd.in/gxcjbJRp

𝟱. 𝗠𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗕𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗰𝘀 (𝟯-𝟰 𝗪𝗲𝗲𝗸𝘀)
→ Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees.
→ Tools: Scikit-learn.
Resource: Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Course → https://lnkd.in/gFwA_Gvq

𝟲. 𝗗𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 (𝟰-𝟲 𝗪𝗲𝗲𝗸𝘀)
→ Topics: Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs.
→ Tools: TensorFlow, PyTorch.
Resource: Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng → https://lnkd.in/g4qZMHxd

𝟳. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 & 𝗣𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗲 (𝗢𝗻𝗴𝗼𝗶𝗻𝗴)
→ Start small: Predictive modeling, image classification, NLP.
→ Platforms: Kaggle, DrivenData.
Resource: Kaggle Competitions → kaggle.com/competitions

𝗧𝗶𝗽𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟱:
→ Leverage AI tools (ChatGPT, AutoML) for faster learning.
→ Focus on projects, not perfection.
→ Don’t just follow tutorials – build, break, and learn.

That’s the roadmap I’d take – no fluff, just results.
